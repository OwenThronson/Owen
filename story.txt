This is the story of Franklin the pug and his extrodinarily strange day. Franklin was a small pug even for pug standards. One day he decided to go on an adventure. The first problem is that he had no idea on where he wanted to go. So he went to talk to his friend the wise old Badger Bucky.

But old Badger Bucky did not have any idea to recommend the place to go to Franklin.
Therefore, they decided to visit the other friend, named Gouggle, who shown off his nice town map several times.

Gouggle showed them his map. On the map, there are several places. There is the cinema, there is the playground, there is an abandoned old factory which is empty. They decided to go to the empty factory for an adventure. 

When they arrived at the empty factory, they heard a loud noise come from inside. They looked around to try and find the source of the noise but found nothing. They decided to look around for a few more minutes to try and find something interesting. 

Then they found it, the greatest treasure of them all, a new dog toy. They were so happy that they walked all the way home wagging their tails. For the rest of the day they played with that new toy. The next day Franklin woke up and decided he was bored with the toy so he wanted to go on a new adventure.
